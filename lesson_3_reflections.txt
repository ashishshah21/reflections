Q Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A The changes in the remote repository may be in conflict with changes in local repository and hence it is better to have control over when the pull is done.


q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A: Fork is a copy of repository on github servers ; f, clone is a copy of  repository from github to local ; branch is making changes whcih i dont want in master. 

q : What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

a : ability to run diff between local/remote and local-remote and remote
