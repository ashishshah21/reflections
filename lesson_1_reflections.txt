Q: How did viewing a diff between two 
versions of a file help you see the bug 
that was introduced ? 

A: Using diff command clearly showed what 
were the changes between the new and 
old versions along with the line numbers.
Even in a 1000 line file, the difference
could be found in a matter of seconds by
looking at the results of the diff command.

Q:How could having easy access to the entire 
history of a file make you a more efficient 
programmer in the long term ? 

A: Having access to the history of file makes
it easy to find what changes were dont to the 
code and when, resulting in effeciency in 
debugging, ease of understanding in case of 
issues and ensuring that no inadvertent overwrites
or mistakes were made when moving from older 
version to a newer version. 

Q: Why do you think some version control systems,
like Git, allow saving multiple files in one 
commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each
file separately ? 

A: Usually coding changes involve changing multiple
related files at the same time. That is why Git has 
the feature for committing multiple files in one commit.
While Google Docs is usually used for stand alone documents
and there is not usually a need to track changes across
multiple files at the same time. 

Q: How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files ? 

A:Command git log is used to see the entire history of all the commits which were done in a project.
It shows the description, time, author , id of the commit. It also shows the list of file(s) which 
were changed along with the number of additions / deletions in each file 
git diff is used to see the exact differences between two different commits, including differences between
multiple files if applicable.

Q: Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for ? 
A: I want to use Git to learn Artificial Intelligence coding and make a fraud detection program using AI.
